Hello, my name is Joe Marcinuk (though I go by Thermobyte on the internet).

I am a Computer Science student in New Hampshire, USA.

I have experience writing mainly in Python, C++, C#, and Java. My favorite of those is Python because its user-friendliness allows me to focus on the problem more, and less on the code/syntax, which is my preferred way to work.

In addition to my schoolwork, I've done work in the fields of Hyrdographic Research and Autonomous Mobile Robots. Most of my work in professional settings has involved work setting up CI/CD systems, as well as writing integration, functional, and regression tests. I have experience in Agile, Object-Oriented Code, unit testing, and all the languages I've listed above.
