Hello, my name is Joe Marcinuk (though I go by Thermobyte on the internet).

I am a Computer Science student in New Hampshire, USA. 
I have experience writing mainly in Python, C, C++, and Java. 
In addition to my schoolwork, I've done work in the fields of Hyrdographic Research and Autonomous Mobile Robots.

If you have any questions for me for whatever reason, you can reach me at my email or my discord:
