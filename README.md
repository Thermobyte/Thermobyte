Hello, my name is Joe Marcinuk (though I go by Thermobyte on the internet).

I have experience writing mainly in Python, C++, C#, and Java. My favorite of those is Python because its user-friendliness allows me to focus on the problem more, and less on the code/syntax, which is my preferred way to work.

In addition to my schoolwork, I've done work in the fields of Hyrdographic Research and Autonomous Mobile Robots. Most of my work in professional settings has involved work setting up CI/CD systems, as well as writing integration, functional, and regression tests. I have experience in Agile, Object-Oriented Code, Git,  unit testing, and all the languages I've listed above. I've also used tools like Jenkins, Docker, MongoDB, and Unity.

My current personal project is far in a way the biggest I've ever undertaken. I am working on a video game codenamed "Project Revenant". The details are not yet public for that, but I hope to make public announcements for that game in the next few months. 

I should mention that, if you've happened upon this page for whatever reason, I'm looking for an artist (preferably one with experience in pixel art and animation) to collaborate on that game with me. If you're interested in that, please contact me (info at the bottom of this bio). I cannot pay you up-front, as I am a lowly student, but you will be considered and equal part of the dev team should that amount to anything.
